People who think they need to lift heavy weights to build big muscles have never used their bodies properly. Get creative with your bodyweight exercises and you can lose fat, get fit, and gain mass without ever hitting a plate or barbell. Think of your body as an empty beam. Change the speed at which you move, hold awkward positions, add instability, and shake those classic moves you’ve been lifting like 40-pound dumbbells your whole life. What do you charge it with? The benefits of working with just <a href="https://puremvmt.com.au" >Bodyweight Training</a> include training without equipment and increased body awareness. You don’t have to worry about bench presses or squat racks, which we think is reason enough to switch to bodyweight workouts.

BODY WEIGHT/ZONE AND TEMPO TRAINING:

Deep Squat.

Hold a towel in your arms and hold it tight. It forces you to keep your chest high and improve your shape. Slowly bend your legs down, keeping your knees apart until your hamstrings touch your calves. Then start the backup slowly.

Bulgarian Squat.

Think of it as an elevated lunge for an added stability challenge. Place one foot, laces down, on a bench behind you and the other in front of you. Keep your bodyweight training and your front knee in line with your toes.

Vary the tempo of each set of these split squats to keep your muscles under load for long periods of muscle building. That’s how it breaks down. The first number indicates how many seconds it takes to descend, then how long it takes and how long it takes to climb. The fifth movement is of maximum isolation, maintaining the deepest position throughout the minute.

Jump Squat With Ground Contact.

Bend your legs, keeping your knees apart and your heels on the floor, and drop into a deep squat. Gently place your hands on the floor and pause for two seconds. Then push off the floor to develop deeper squat strength.

Bridge Strike.

Sit on the floor with one leg bent, the other straight, and your toes pointing toward your feet. Press into the floor and squeeze your glutes to slowly raise your hips until they are level with your stabilizing knee, while lifting your right leg until it forms a 90-degree angle with your chest. First go down slowly. Do all reps on one side, then switch.

Burpee With Push-ups.

From a standing position, lower yourself and place your hands on the floor outside of your feet. Jump your feet back and do a push-up, then bring your feet back between your hands. Jump and clap your hands above your head. Do 10 reps of 5A, then go straight to 10 on each side of 5B. Then nine, eight and so on, rest as needed.

Skipped Slot.

Start in a forward lunge position with arms straight for balance. Jump off the ground lifting your front leg. Switch legs for each repetition.

Bring Up.

Start in a push-up position. Bend your arms to lower your chest until it lifts off the floor as you bring one knee to your elbow, then return to start. alternate knees. When you are done with the reps, go straight to 1B without rest. On the last single rep, go super slow, do it for ten counts.

Pulling.

Grab a barbell with an overhand grip so your palms are facing outward and your hands are twice shoulder-width apart. Tighten your upper back muscles and pull your sternum toward the bar. Then lower in a controlled manner. Rest 5 seconds per repetition. Same exercise for the last repetition: Take ten seconds.

L-shaped Seat Lift.

Hang on to a pull-up bar with a grip. Contract your core and bring your legs together until they are parallel to the ground. From there, squeeze your upper back and raise yourself up until your chin is above the bar. Lower yourself to a clean stop between each rep.

Jump With Burpee.

Lower your hands to the floor and bring your feet back into the top push-up position. Jump your feet back, then come up to jump explosively. Bend your knees to cushion the landing and move on to the next rep.

Hanging Leg Lift.

Brace your core and bring your legs together until they’re parallel to the floor, then bring them back to the start. Keep your core engaged at all times to avoid swinging.
